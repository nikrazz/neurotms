									<p>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a recognised&nbsp;<a
											href="tms-for-depression-does-it-really-work.html">treatment for
											depression</a>&nbsp;and other neurological conditions.</p>

									<p>Clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of TMS in the treatment of
										depression, particularly in patients who have not responded well to
										anti-depressant medication.</p>

									<p>TMS is a non-invasive treatment delivered by an external magnetic coil placed
										lightly touching the scalp. The coil sends repetitive electromagnetic pulses to
										stimulate neuron activity in specific
										surface areas of the brain that regulate mood.</p>

									<p>TMS is a recognised treatment for depression by the Royal Australian and New
										Zealand College of Psychiatrists (<a
											href="https://www.ranzcp.org/news-policy/policy-and-advocacy/position-statements/repetitive-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation">RANZCP

									<h2>What Conditions Does TMS Treat?</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-8">
									<p>The most common condition for TMS treatment is depression.</p>

									<p>TMS has also been used to treat:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),</li>
										<li>auditory hallucinations,</li>
										<li>post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),</li>

									<h2>What is TMS Therapy for Depression?</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-8">
									<p>The most common target of TMS treatment is depression. Magnetic therapy for
										depression dates back to the 1980s.</p>

									<p>Increasing evidence of TMS effectiveness, especially the TMS depression success
										rate, has recently led to a much
										wider availability of TMS therapy.</p>

									<p>An initial course of TMS therapy consists of around 30 to 35 sessions at a TMS
										clinic, each visit taking 30-60
										minutes.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="row" id="how-tms-works">
								<div class="col-lg-4">
									<h2>How Does TMS Treatment Work?</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-8">
									<p>Our brains help manage our thoughts via electrical and chemical messengers. Each
										thought is associated with certain
										pathways that these signals travel along. The more our brain practices certain
										pathways the better it gets at
										whatever we practice.</p>

									<p>In depression, the brain has significantly less activity in the frontal lobe and
										limbic system. We can actually see
										this in CT scans. In depression you could say the limbic system is way out of
										practice.</p>

									<p>In TMS therapy, a coil is placed over the head and uses an electromagnetic field
										to induce an action potential in the
										neurons of the brain, a clinical term which basically means it activates the
										neuron. An action potential in one
										neuron causes others around it to fire, and so on.</p>

									<p>Repeated stimulation reaches deep areas of our brain using this neuron roadway.
										Specifically, the limbic system
										trains the known pathways that are associated with being happier, more relaxed,
										content and less anxious.</p>

									<p>While a single positive thought can train a particular pathway once, a single TMS
										treatment session can practice that
										same pathway 3000-5000 times.</p>

									<p>A typical TMS course of 30 to 35 sessions can stimulate positive pathways
										90,000-150,000 times.</p>

									<p>It is thought that this practice is what leads to the improvement in mood that we
										see clinically. Just imagine
										practicing kicking a football or practicing a golf swing 150,000 times, you
										would become very skilled. It is just
										like this, practice makes perfect. It&rsquo;s like muscle memory for your brain.

								<div class="col-lg-4">
									<h2>Why TMS Therapy Is Effective?</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-8">
									<p>TMS therapy is effective because it subtly corrects the neural pathways that
										underlies depression, as well as
										boosting levels of deficient neurotransmitters.</p>

									<p>TMS side effects are generally minimal, which means that fewer patients need to
										stop treatment before it has a chance
										to work.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-lg-4">
									<h2>How Long Does TMS Treatment Last?</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-8">
									<p>After a full course of TMS treatment, most patients will experience improved
										symptoms for 6-12 months.</p>

									<p>One <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804736">study</a> of patients
										who completed TMS depression
										treatment showed that a year later, 68% were still improved, and 45% had no
										symptoms. Another study was even more
										encouraging, with almost two thirds of patients showing no symptoms of
										depression a full year after treatment.</p>

									<p>Note also that these patients have been unsuccessful with at least two
										antidepressants.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-lg-4">
									<h2>How is TMS Treatment Performed?</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-8">
									<p>To undergo TMS therapy, there is no need for fasting or an anaesthetic.</p>

									<p>The patient sits comfortably in a reclining armchair and is awake throughout each
										treatment. The patient&rsquo;s head
										is carefully measured by a trained technician to determine the optimal location
										for treatment.</p>

									<p>TMS treatment is non-invasive. The stimulating coil is placed beside the head,
										lightly touching the scalp. The
										patient will hear a ticking sound and may feel a mild tapping sensation on the
										side of their head.</p>

									<p>TMS treatment is provided on an outpatient basis or can be part of a treatment
										plan for hospital in-patients.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-lg-4">
									<h2>How Long Does TMS Treatment Take?</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-8">
									<p>TMS treatment is generally administered as a course of 30 treatments over six
										weeks.</p>

									<p>Regular psychometric testing is conducted to monitor your response to treatment.
										At the end of the course of
										treatment, a NeuroCentrixTMS psychiatrist will discuss the psychometric test
										results with you and report to your
										treating physician.</p>

									<p>When patients have achieved significant improvement in their condition, a
										maintenance course of treatment is often
										recommended.</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="row m-left-40">
								<div class="col-lg-4">
									<h2>Are There Any Side Effects?</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-8">
									<p>TMS therapy is generally well tolerated but may produce some side effects such
										as:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>tension headache,</li>
										<li>lightheadedness,</li>
										<li>nausea,</li>
										<li>a tingling sensation in the face or discomfort at the application site.</li>
									</ul>

									<p>Headache is the most common side effect which responds to over the counter
										painkillers. Most people find that side
										effects lessen as treatment progresses.</p>

									<p>Unlike some other depression therapies, TMS treatment does not cause memory loss,
										weight gain or loss of libido.</p>

									<p>There is a small risk of seizure. If you suffer from epilepsy or have had a head
										injury, you may not be suitable for
										TMS treatment.</p>

									<p>To date, there have been no recognised long-term negative effects reported from
										TMS treatment. However, it should be
										noted that TMS is a relatively new treatment and research into long-term effects
										is on going.</p>

							<div class="row m-left-40">
								<div class="col-lg-4">
									<h2>Is TMS Right for Me?</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-8">
									<p>TMS is only offered after a thorough assessment and discussion with one of our
										psychiatrists. However, TMS may be
										right for you if:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>You suffer from symptoms of depression</li>
										<li>Anti-depressants have failed to remove your symptoms</li>
										<li>Anti-depressants have caused unpleasant side effects</li>
										<li>You cannot take anti-depressants because of another condition.</li>
									</ul>

									<p>On the other hand, TMS is unlikely to be suitable if you have a metal implant,
										such as a pacemaker or defibrillator.

									<h2>Do I Need a Referral for TMS Treatment?</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-8">

									<h2>What Does TMS Cost?</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-8">
									<p>TMS treatment for depression at our TMS clinic typically consists of 30 to 35
										sessions delivered as an outpatient
										over 4 to 6 weeks.</p>

									<p>Outpatient treatment allows you to stay at home with family and friends during
										treatment rather than being admitted
										to hospital. Following your initial course of TMS therapy, your doctor may
										recommend maintenance treatment.</p>

									<p>TMS treatment costs may be met in full for serving military, DVA, and WorkCover
										patients upon successful application.
										After referral to NeuroCentrixTMS, we look after the paperwork and prepare the
										application on your behalf.</p>

									<p>Private treatment is available at $196 per session.</p>

									<p>As of November 2021, Federal Government announced funding to provide access to <a
											href="http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publishing.nsf/Content/Factsheet-rTMS+">Medicare-subsidised</a>
										repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for the treatment of medication

									<p>Studies have shown that a course of TMS therapy usually produces substantial
										benefit even one year later. Meanwhile
										no long-term adverse effects have been found.</p>
